# 🚀 Optimize (Agentic Auditor v3.0)

Performance and debt audit with auto-skill detection.

## 0. [AGENT] Orchestrator: Intelligence Setup
- [ ] **Model Router**: Optimization is `[HEAVY]` → Recommend Pro/Sonnet.
- [ ] **Skill Discovery**: Auto-load `performance-optimization`, `code-quality-reviewer`, `react-best-practices`.

## 1. [AGENT] Architect: Static Audit
- [ ] **Scan**: Identify code smells and complexity.
- [ ] **Metrics**: Define target improvements (bundle size, rerenders).

## 2. [AGENT] Lead Dev: Refactoring
- [ ] **Execute**: Apply performance patterns and type strengthening.

## 3. [AGENT] Critic: Side-Effect Check
- [ ] **Audit**: Ensure no behavioral changes during optimization.
- [ ] **Debate**: Record in `.agent/memory/agent_debate.md` (IN ENGLISH).
- [ ] **Verify**: Run `test-automator` for regression-free code.

## 4. [AGENT] Secretary: Technical Report
- [ ] **History (EN)**: Document "Before vs After" metrics in `.agent/memory/feature_history_en.md`.
- [ ] **History (KR)**: Document "Before vs After" metrics in `.agent/memory/feature_history_kr.md`.
