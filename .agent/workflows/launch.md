# 🚀 Launch (Agentic Engine v3.0)

Strategic feature inception with auto-skill detection and model routing.

## 0. [AGENT] Orchestrator: Intelligence Setup
- [ ] **Model Router**: Architecture tasks are always `[HEAVY]` → Recommend Pro/Sonnet.
- [ ] **Skill Discovery**: Scan `conductor/tech-stack.md` and auto-load relevant architecture skills.
- [ ] **Board Init**: Initialize `.agent/memory/task_board.md`.

## 1. [AGENT] Orchestrator: Goal Alignment
- [ ] **Context Sync**: Read `conductor/product.md` and `conductor/tech-stack.md`.
- [ ] **Strategy**: Load `startup-business-analyst-market-opportunity` for value verification.

## 2. [AGENT] Architect: Blueprinting
- [ ] **Design**: Draft technical plan:
    - [ ] `fsd-lite` directory structure.
    - [ ] API contracts (using `api-design-principles`).
- [ ] **Boarding**: Generate task breakdown in `task_board.md`.

## 3. [AGENT] Critic: Strategic Audit
- [ ] **Critique**: Audit plan for technical debt and token waste.
- [ ] **Debate**: Record critique in `.agent/memory/agent_debate.md` (IN ENGLISH).
- [ ] **Iterate**: If rejected, Architect must refactor.

## 4. [USER] Final Sign-off
- [ ] **Present**: Show orchestrated `task_board.md` to user for approval.
