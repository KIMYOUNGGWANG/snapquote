# 🚀 Launch Workflow (Ace Edition)

Use this for new features or projects. Focuses on setting the stage with CPO/CTO precision.

## 1. Context Alignment (`context-driven-development`)
- [ ] **Sync**: Read `conductor/product.md` and `conductor/tech-stack.md`.
- [ ] **Verify**: Ensure I understand the "Why" and "What" before writing a single line of code.

## 2. Elite Planning (`planning-with-files`)
- [ ] **Initialize**: Create `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md`.
- [ ] **Phase Breakdown**: Define clear milestones.
- [ ] **Architectural Review**: Use `senior-architect` skill to critique the plan before approval.

## 3. User Sign-off
- [ ] **Present**: Show the `task_plan.md` to the user for final approval.
