# ✨ UI/UX Improvement Workflow

Focuses on aesthetics, usability, and the "Wow" factor.

## 1. Audit (`ui-ux-designer`)
- [ ] **Current State**: Analyze existing UI against `web-design-guidelines`.
- [ ] **Pain Points**: Identify friction in user flow.

## 2. Polishing (`clean-code` for CSS)
- [ ] **Styling**: Refine CSS/Tailwind using `modern-css-patterns`.
- [ ] **Micro-animations**: Add subtle transitions for "Premium" feel.

## 3. Verification (`ui-visual-validator`)
- [ ] **Visual Check**: Inspect rendered components for alignment and color harmony.
