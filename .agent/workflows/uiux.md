# ✨ UI/UX (Agentic Engine v3.0)

Aesthetic refinement with auto-skill detection and design debate.

## 0. [AGENT] Orchestrator: Intelligence Setup
- [ ] **Model Router**: Design tasks are `[HEAVY]` → Recommend Pro/Sonnet.
- [ ] **Skill Discovery**: Auto-load `anti-ai-design`, `modern-css-patterns`, `ui-visual-validator`.
- [ ] **Lazy Load**: Load `resources/design-principles.md` for advanced tokens.

## 1. [AGENT] Designer: Aesthetic Audit
- [ ] **Analyze**: Review UI against `anti-ai-design` principles.
- [ ] **Typography**: Verify modern fonts (Inter, Outfit) are in use.

## 2. [AGENT] Lead Dev: Styling
- [ ] **Refine**: Apply smooth transitions and soft shadows.
- [ ] **Micro-animations**: Implement subtle interactions for "Live" feel.

## 3. [AGENT] Critic: Pixel-Perfect Review
- [ ] **Debate**: Record design critique in `.agent/memory/agent_debate.md` (IN ENGLISH).
- [ ] **Iterate**: Designer refines until "WOW" factor achieved.

## 4. [AGENT] Secretary: Documentation
- [ ] **History (EN)**: Append to `.agent/memory/feature_history_en.md`.
- [ ] **History (KR)**: Append to `.agent/memory/feature_history_kr.md`.
