# 💡 Ideate Workflow (The Idea Forge)

Use this BEFORE `launch`. This is for when you have a raw idea and want to expand, critique, and validate it.

## 1. Discovery & Research (`deep-research`)
- [ ] **Market Scan**: Search for existing solutions and identify gaps.
- [ ] **Tech Feasibility**: Check if the required technology is available and mature.

## 2. Multi-Agent Brainstorming (`multi-agent-brainstorming`)
- [ ] **Expert Panel**: I will summon 가상 CPO, CTO, and Marketer personas.
- [ ] **Endless Debate**: Let the agents critique the idea, find pitfalls, and propose "Killer Features".
- [ ] **User Feedback**: User (You) intervenes to steer the direction based on agent suggestions.

## 3. Strategy Summary (`brainstorming`)
- [ ] **Final Concept**: Summarize the refined idea.
- [ ] **Ready for Launch**: Prepare the core message to be handed over to the `launch` workflow.
