# 💡 Ideation & Validation Workflow

## Role
- **Goal**: Turn raw ideas into validated concepts.
- **Participants**: CIO (Brainstorming), CMO (Marketing), CRO (Tech Research), CPO (Planning).

## Steps

1.  **Diverge (CIO)**
    - Generate 10+ variations of the core idea.
    - Ask: "What if we did the opposite?", "How would a giant company do this?"

2.  **Market Validation (CMO)**
    - "Who needs this?"
    - "Is it sellable?" (Check trends, keywords).
    - "What is the hook?"

3.  **Tech Feasibility (CRO)**
    - "Is it possible within 2 weeks?"
    - "What is the risk?" (Cost, complexity).

4.  **Converge (CPO)**
    - Select ONE best idea.
    - Define the MVP scope.
    - Output: A clear "One-Pager" concept.
