description: Run the Full Development Lifecycle (Ideate -> Ship)
---

# ♾️ Full Cycle Workflow (The Master Loop)

This is the **God Mode** workflow. It chains specific phases together to take a raw idea to a shipped feature in one continuous run. Use with caution/patience.

## 1. Phase 1: Inception (`ideate` + `launch`)
- [ ] **Ideate**: Run the `ideate` chain to refine the concept.
- [ ] **Launch**: Lock in the PRD and `task_plan.md` using the `launch` workflow.

## 2. Phase 2: Blueprint (`design`)
- [ ] **Design**: Execute `design` workflow to finalize Architecture and/or UI mocks.

## 3. Phase 3: Construction (`develop`)
- [ ] **Develop**: Iterate through `task_plan.md` using the `develop` workflow (TDD + Clean Code).

## 4. Phase 4: Polish (`uiux`)
- [ ] **Polishing**: If UI is involved, run `uiux` workflow for final aesthetic touches.

## 5. Phase 5: Delivery (`ship`)
- [ ] **Ship**: Perform final Security Audit (CISO) and generate PR ($ship).
