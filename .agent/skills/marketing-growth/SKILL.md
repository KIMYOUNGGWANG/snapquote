# Marketing & Growth Strategy (CMO)

## When to use this skill
- When the user asks for "copywriting", "social media posts", "ad creatives".
- When planning product launches or growth experiments.
- When generating image prompts for DALL-E/Midjourney.

## Workflow
1.  **Analyze Context**: Target audience, platform (Instagram, Blog, Email), and goal.
2.  **Select Framework**: Choose AIDA, PAS, or Storytelling based on the goal.
3.  **Draft Content**: Write the copy or prompt.
4.  **Review**: Check against brand voice (`voice-tone.md`).
5.  **Iterate**: Refine hooks and CTAs.

## Instructions

### Copywriting Frameworks
1.  **AIDA** (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action): Best for landing pages/ads.
2.  **PAS** (Problem, Agitation, Solution): Best for sales emails/pain-point posts.
3.  **Viral Hook**: Start with a controversial or surprising statement.

### Image Prompt Engineering
**Structure**: `[Subject] + [Style/Vibe] + [Lighting] + [Composition] + [Tech Details]`
- **Example**: "A futuristic dashboard floating in a nebula, cyberpunk style, neon purple lighting, wide angle, 8k resolution, unreal engine 5 render."

### Channel Strategy
- **Instagram**: Visual-first, emoji usage, heavy hashtags.
- **LinkedIn**: Professional tone, "lessons learned", value-driven.
- **Blog**: SEO-optimized, clear headings, educational value.
